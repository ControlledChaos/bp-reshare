# BP Reshare

This is a BuddyPress plugin extending the Activity component with a reshare feature. Members will be able to promote the activity updates they found interesting by "re" sharing them into their personal activity stream.

All Activity streams will be ordered according to the latest reshared date of the displayed activities. To see the list of users who reshared or favorited an activity, you simply need to display its single view.

## User's profile "Reshared activities"

This tab is listing the activities of the displayed user that have been reshared by others.

## Activity Directory's "My Reshares"

This tab is listing the activities the logged in user reshared.


## Post Type activities

If the Blogs component is also active, then single views of each post type supporting the BuddyPress Activity feature will contain new buttons over the comments list to let logged in users directly reshare or favorite the Post Type Activity.

## Notifications

If the notifications component is active, each time an activity will be reshared, his author will find a new screen notification informing him about it.

## Options

From the BuddyPress Settings screen, you can go to the Options tab to set some options for the feature such as :

- sending email notifications when an activity is reshared.
- disabling the reshare feature for the activity types of your choice.
- using the default order for the Activity stream.


Available in french and english.
