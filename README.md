This is a **BuddyPress** plugin extending the Activity component with a reshare feature. Members will be able to promote the activity updates they found interesting by **re**-sharing them into their personal activity stream.

All Activity streams will be ordered according to the latest reshared date of the displayed activities. To see the list of users who reshared or favorited an activity, you simply need to display its single view.

## User's profile "Reshared activities"

If the Blogs component is active, then single views of each post type supporting the BuddyPress Activity feature will contain new buttons over the comments list to let logged in users directly reshare or favorite the Post Type Activity.

## Notifications
